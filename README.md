Project Started - 04/28/2022

04/28/2022 - Currently, I am a student of the #100Devs program, taught by Leon Noel. I recently just started learning JavaScript, and wanted to apply my knowledge by creating a picker/selector webpage. I am a big Studio Ghibli fan and have decided to make a "Spirited Away" character picker, which will allow a user to select a character within the movie and learn more about them.

Created most of the HTML structure for the webpage (Missing - Static Images and Character Bio). Created HTML, CSS, and JS files. Created assets folder and started collecting media, all GIFS so far.

04/29/2022 - Finished coding and structuring HTML. Created assets/images folder. Found, edited and incorporated all images I wanted to use. Began coding CSS. 

05/01/2022 - Finished project. Updated HTML and CSS. Added JS file. Added assets/audio folder. Added audio file and link to HTML. Made mobile responsive.
